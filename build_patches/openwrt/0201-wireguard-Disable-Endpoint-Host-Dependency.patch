Subject: wireguard: Disable Endpoint Host Dependency

When using IPv6 addresses (or DNS which has AAAA record) as endpoint,
add_host_dependency fails for some reason which causes the wireguard
interface to disappear.

Because it is not necessary for us anyway, host_dependency is disabled
for wireguard with this patch.
